# MyTypist Backend Development Rules & Instructions

## Project Overview
MyTypist is a document template creation and management SaaS platform with the following core features:
- Document template creation and editing with placeholder extraction
- Token-based payment system with subscription plans
- Multi-role system (Guest, User, Moderator, Admin)
- Advanced document processing and batch operations
- Comprehensive admin dashboard with analytics

## Core Development Standards

### 1. Production-Ready Code Only
- **NO TODO comments** - implement actual functionality
- **NO placeholder/mock implementations** - build real integrations
- **NO "In production, this would..." comments** - implement production logic now
- **NO commented-out code** - clean, working code only
- **NO development-stage indicators** - this is production-ready code
- Remove all comments like "Remove this for local development"

### 2. Database Configuration
- **PostgreSQL ONLY** - no SQLite, remove all SQLite references
- Optimize PostgreSQL performance to maximum capacity
- Use proper indexing and query optimization
- Implement connection pooling and performance monitoring

### 3. File Structure & Organization
- **NO duplicate files** - upgrade existing files instead of creating new ones
- **NO version indicators** (v2, enhanced, advanced) in file/route names
- **NO conflicting routes** - clean, consistent API structure
- Merge any duplicated functionality into main codebase
- Follow single responsibility principle

### 4. API Route Standards
```
✅ CORRECT: /api/auth/login
❌ WRONG: /api/v2/auth/login, /api/auth/enhanced-login
```
- Clean, RESTful routes without version numbers
- Consistent naming conventions
- No duplicate endpoints

### 5. Authentication & Security
- Implement proper JWT token management
- **NO 2FA or API key selling** - this is an MVP startup
- Robust fraud detection for free token abuse
- Advanced device/user tracking across browsers
- Secure payment processing with card storage
- Email verification system (non-blocking registration)

## Role-Based System

### Roles Hierarchy
1. **Guest** - Can create 1 free document, view previews
2. **User** - Token-based document creation, subscriptions
3. **Moderator** - Content moderation, feedback management
4. **Admin** - Full system control, analytics, template management

### User Registration & Free Tokens
- Guest users get 1 free document creation
- Advanced fraud detection prevents abuse
- Device fingerprinting and tracking
- Free token only granted once per device/user combination
- Seamless registration flow during document creation

## Document Processing System

### Placeholder Logic
- **Signature placeholders**: File upload with background removal
- **Address placeholders**: Smart comma-based line breaking
- **Image placeholders**: Pixel (x,y) positioning parameters
- **Admin controls**: Individual styling per placeholder instance
- **User experience**: Single input fills multiple similar placeholders

### Document Creation Flow
1. User searches/selects template
2. Fills form with placeholders
3. Real-time preview generation
4. Payment/token deduction
5. PDF generation and download
6. Auto-save to drafts system

### Batch Processing
- Select multiple templates
- Consolidate duplicate inputs
- Individual formatting preserved
- Bulk download with proper file naming
- Token deduction per document

## Payment & Token System

### Token Management
- Admin-configurable token rates (e.g., 100 NGN = 1000 tokens)
- Minimum/maximum purchase limits
- Wallet system to avoid payment gateway stress
- Auto-renewal for subscriptions
- Flexible token purchasing for subscribers

### Subscription Plans
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Token purchases only
- **Business**: Monthly token allocation + ability to buy extra
- **Enterprise**: Higher monthly allocation + premium features
- Display expiration dates and renewal options
- Secure recurring billing with stored payment methods

## Admin Dashboard Requirements

### Template Management
- Upload document with immediate editing interface
- Placeholder extraction {} and configuration
- Bulk pricing updates by category/tag
- Template categorization and tagging system
- Preview image and extraction document separation
- Template marketplace management

### User Management
- View, suspend, delete users
- Role assignment (create moderators)
- User statistics and monitoring
- Bulk operations and filtering

## Advanced Features

### Document Sharing System
- Temporary preview links with passwords
- Time-limited access (configurable hours)

- Comment system for feedback
- Auto-expiring security measures

### SEO & Marketing
- Individual pages for each template
- Meta tags and social sharing optimization
- Google indexing for document discovery
- Landing page search with real-time filtering
- Responsive preview containers

### Notification System

## Final Notes

This is an company code. Every feature must be:
- Production-ready and professional
- Scalable and maintainable
- User-friendly and intuitive
- Secure and compliant
- Fast and responsive

The goal is to create a platform that appears to be built by a large, professional team. No shortcuts, no placeholders, no "TODO" items - everything must be complete and functional.
